2. What you can share and do on OneHealth?

We can remove content you share in violation of these provisions and, if applicable, we may take
action against your account, for the reasons described below. We may also disable your account if
you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights.
To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe
violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.
The permissions you give us
We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
 Permission to use Data generated by your facility or from your consult to a facility: You own
the content you generate on OneHealth , and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights
you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,
wherever you want. To provide our services, though, we need you to give us some legal
permissions to use that content.
Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property

rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-
exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use,

distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative
works of your content. This means, for example, if a test result is generated from your
consult, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others.
You can end this license any time by deleting your content or account. You should know
that, for technical reasons, content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in
backup copies (though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content you delete
may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and they have not deleted it.
 Permission to use your name, profile picture, and clinical information: You give us
permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions you have
taken on OneHealth next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored content
that we display in our Product, without any compensation to you. For example, we may
show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Page
created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on OneHealth. Ads like this can be seen
only by all.
 Permission to update software you use or download: If you download or use our software,
you give us permission to download and install upgrades, updates, and additional features to
improve, enhance, and further develop it.
Limits on using our intellectual property
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our
Products, we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or
trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted with our prior written permission. You
must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, create
derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.

Updating our Terms
We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better
for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to
accurately reflect our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you
before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go
into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use
our Products.
We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms
and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook community, you can delete your account at any
time.
Account suspension or termination
If we determine that you have violated our terms or policies, we may take action against your
account to protect our community and services, including by suspending access to your account or
disabling it. We may also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure for us
or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where appropriate, we will notify you about
your account the next time you try to access it.
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you
and us, but the following provisions will remain in place:
Limits on liability
We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who
uses them. Our Products, however, are provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they
always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or
imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people
and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or
offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other
objectionable content).
We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be
limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable
to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect,
exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the use of
OneHealth Product, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Disputes

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If
a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws
will apply.
If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of
action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the OneHealth
Products ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has
jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in
the Lagos. District Court for Lagos, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these
courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of Lagos State, Nigeria, will
govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
